    "In this notebook, we will learn how to create and solve mixed integer programs with PuLP in Python.\n",
    "We will do this using examples. The first one is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $I$ be a set of items, $W = \\{2, 3, 1, 5, 3\\}$ be the multi-set (which allows repetition) of weigths of each item  in $i$ in $I$ and $C=10$ the weight capacity of a recipient. Let us write a model to maximise the number of items to put into the recipient without exceeding the weight capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to define the binary variable $x_i$ which is equal to 1 if item $i$ should be included in the recipient. Then, we can write the model:\n",
    "\n",
    "Max $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5$ \n",
